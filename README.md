# ✨ ElectraPay: Decentralized Recurring Payments on Electroneum 🚀

## 🌟 Project Overview

ElectraPay is a decentralized recurring payments platform built on the Electroneum blockchain. It empowers organizations and individuals to automate payments securely and affordably, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## 🤔 The Problem We Solve

We identified key challenges in both Web2 and Web3 payment systems:

**Web2 Issues:**

*   High fees for recurring payments charged by traditional banks 💸.
*   Limited access to financial services for unbanked populations 🚫.
*   Centralized control leading to inefficiencies and potential payment failures 💔.

**Web3 Issues:**

*   Lack of seamless, user-friendly recurring payment solutions 🤷‍♂️.
*   Gas fees and wallet management complexities ⛽.
*   Smart contract-based subscriptions are underdeveloped 📜.

ElectraPay bridges this gap, offering the best of both worlds! ✅
